# Linear-Models

This was a project done for the seminar "Data Mining" at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) during Summer Semester 2021. The topic of the paper was 
"Linear Models for Classification and Regression". To understand the theory of Multiple Linear Regression and Binary Logsitic Regression better, these statistical models 
were applied to real datasets as case studies. The slides of the presentation, the paper and the corresponding code is saved here in the repository.
